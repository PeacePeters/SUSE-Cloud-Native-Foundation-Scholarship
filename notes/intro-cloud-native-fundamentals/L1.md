### Introduction to Cloud Native

Cloud-native refers to the set of practices that empowers an organization to build and manage applications at scale.  It is an approach to building and running applications that exploits the advantages of the cloud computing delivery model.
Cloud native technologies empower organizations to 
* Build and run scalabe applications
+ Using modern, dynamic environments such as on-prem, public or hybrid cloud

> The key to cloud native deployment is `speed` and `agility`, or how quickly an organization can respond to change and increase its feature velocity.

Containers, microservices, declarative APIs, etc. are closely associated with cloud-native terminology. What then are containers?

Containers are:
- Small units of an application
* Deployed fast and resiliently
- Well fitted with microservice-based architecture

> Microservices are used to manage and configure a collection of small, independent services that can be easily packaged and executed within a container.

### CNCF and Cloud-Native Tooling

With the use of containers came the need for tools that can manage containers at scale. Examples are of such tools are Docker Swaem, Apache Mesos & Kubernetes. However, Kubernetes took the lead in defining how containerized workloads should be deployed, managed, and configured.

> Kubernete is a container orchestrator that automates the configuration, management, and scalability of an application.

Facts about Kubernetes and CNCF

Overall, Kubernetes is a container orchestrator that is capable to solutionize the integration of the following functionalities:

**Funtionalities** | **Usage**
--- | --- 
Runtime | For application execution environment
Networking | For application connectivity
Storage | For application resources
Service Mesh | For granular control of the traffic within a cluster
Logs and metrics | To construct the observability stack
Tracing | For building the full request journey

Reasons for adoption of cloud-native technologies includes:
* With the use of cloud-native tooling, engineering teams can enable quick delivery of value to customers.
* The team can also easily extend to new features and technologies to accommodate new requirements.

For cloud-native adoption, there are two main perspectives to address: **business and technical stakeholders.**

### Business perspective
From a business perspective, the adoption of cloud-native tooling represents:

* *Agility:* perform strategic transformations for acceleration of business velocity
* *Growth:* quickly iterate on customer feedback that can increase customer satisfaction and lead to growth of customer base
* *Service:* availability - ensures the product is available to customers 24/7

> For example, with the adoption of microservices architecture, it is easier to identify an error service and recover it. This reduces the blast radius of a failure, and facilatates the frequent service release.

### Technical perspective
From a technical perspective, the adoption of cloud-native tooling represents:

* *Automation:* release a service without human intervention e.g. constructing a pipeline to deploy a service to production with human intervention.
* *Orchestration:* introduce a container orchestrator to manage thousands of services with minimal effort
* *Observability:* encompasses the segregation of an application to multiple services aand the bility to independently troubleshoot and debug each component
